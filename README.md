<h2 align="center">An Introduction</h2> 

We've all had those long days or weeks at work where it get's to 4 o'clock and we're staring at the clock thinking 
about what beverage we're going to treat ourselves to when we get home. We all know it's naughty, and definitely not 
good for our bodies if not enjoyed in moderation- but that doesn't stop us from wanting to partake on a journey of creativity 
and discovery when it comes to enjoying a nice cold beverage after a hard day in the office.

What's your tail? Is a website built around Cocktails, a centre for people to express their creativity and share their ideas 
and recipes with a like-minded community. Whether you want some inspiration, or you want to inspire others with a mouthwatering 
concoction of your own discovery or creation- this is the place to be!

What's your tail is my third Milestone project for submission to the Code Institute Full Stack Web Development Diploma that 
I am currently enrolled as a student on.

## Design

#### Colour Scheme 
I used the [Coolors](coolors.co) to generate and find a colour pallette to use for this website. The pallete i decided upon 
can be found [here](https://coolors.co/fefffe-e5fcf5-b3dec1-210124-750d37). Here is a list of the colours and their respective 
hex codes:
- White #FEFFFE
- Light Cyan #E5FCF5
- Turquoise Green #B3DEC1 
- Dark Purple #210124
- Claret #750D37 

#### Typography 

#### Icons 
In this project, I will use the Google Icons Library. You can take a look at their library [here](https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Icons&icon.query=file)

#### Images 
Due to users being able to use images URL's when creating their own recipes, Images will come from a variety of sources in the end. 
However, I will use free stock images from [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/) for this project.
